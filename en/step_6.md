## What next?

- A real theremin has a secondary control to change the amplitude (volume) of the tone being played. You could do this with a second Ultrasonic distance sensor.

- What happens if you change the timing in the Python file? Can you produce a smoother transition of notes?

- Have a play with different synths, as shown in the Sonic Pi help menu. What effect does changing the synth have on your theremin?
